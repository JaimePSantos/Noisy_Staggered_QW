abstract="An interesting problem in the area of algorithms is the spatial search problem, which aims to find one or more marked points in a finite physical region that can be modeled by a graph, for instance, a two-dimensional finite lattice, so that the vertices of the graph are the places one can search and the edges are the pathways one can use to move from one vertex to an adjacent one. The quantum version of this problem was analyzed by Benioff inBenioff a very concrete way. He imagined a quantum robot thatQuantum robot moves to adjacent vertices in a time unit. The position of the robot can be a superposition of a finite number of places (vertices). How many steps does the robot need to take in order to find a marked vertex withMarked vertex high probability? In this problem, we suppose that the robot only finds the marked vertex by stepping on it and the robot has no hint about the direction of the marked vertex and no compass and no memory.",

abstract = {There is much interest in developing quantum computers in order to perform certain tasks much faster than, or that are intractable for, a classical computer. A general quantum computer, however, requires the fabrication and operation a number of quantum logic devices (see the Perspective by Franson). Broome et al. (p. 794, published online 20 December) and Spring et al. (p. 798, published online 20 December) describe experiments in which single photons and quantum interference were used to perform a calculation (the permanent of a matrix) that is very difficult on a classical computer. Similar to random walks, quantum walks on a graph describe the movement of a walker on a set of predetermined paths; instead of flipping a coin to decide which way to go at each point, a quantum walker can take several paths at once. Childs et al. (p. 791) propose an architecture for a quantum computer, based on quantum walks of multiple interacting walkers. The system is capable of performing any quantum operation using a subset of its nodes, with the size of the subset scaling favorably with the complexity of the operation. A scalable quantum computer architecture based on multiple interacting quantum walkers is proposed. [Also see Perspective by Franson] A quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum-mechanical process on a graph defined by analogy to classical random walk. The quantum walker is a particle that moves from a given vertex to adjacent vertices in quantum superposition. We consider a generalization to interacting systems with more than one walker, such as the Bose-Hubbard model and systems of fermions or distinguishable particles with nearest-neighbor interactions, and show that multiparticle quantum walk is capable of universal quantum computation. Our construction could, in principle, be used as an architecture for building a scalable quantum computer with no need for time-dependent control.}}

abstract = {We introduce some new perfect state transfer and generalized long-distance teleportation schemes by quantum walks with two coins. By encoding the transferred information in the coin-1 state and alternately using two coin operators, we can perfectly recover the information in the coin-1 state at the target position by at most two flipping operations. On the basis of quantum walks with two coins on either a line or an N-circle, we can perfectly transfer any qubit state. In addition, using quantum walks with two coins on regular graphs, we can first implement a perfect qudit state transfer by quantum walks. Compared with existing schemes driven by one coin, more general graph structures can be used to perfectly transfer a more general state. We also study how to realize generalized teleportation over long-distance walks by the above quantum walk models.}

  abstract = {Generations of physics students have been taught to think of one-dimensional random walks in terms of a drunken sailor taking random steps to the right or to the left. But that doesn't compare with the complexity of a quantum walker, who can propagate down multiple paths at the same time. Preiss et al. detected particles in single sites of an optical lattice to study the dynamics of two interacting atoms of 87Rb performing a quantum walk (see the Perspective by Widera). Depending on the initial conditions and the interaction strength between the atoms, the atoms either ignored each other, stuck to each other, or tried to get as far away from each other as possible. Science, this issue p. 1229; see also p. 1200 A quantum microscope is used to study the dynamics of two interacting 87Rb atoms performing a quantum walk. [Also see Perspective by Widera] Full control over the dynamics of interacting, indistinguishable quantum particles is an important prerequisite for the experimental study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the implementation of high-fidelity quantum information processing. We demonstrate such control over the quantum walk‚Äîthe quantum mechanical analog of the classical random walk‚Äîin the regime where dynamics are dominated by interparticle interactions. Using interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we directly observed fundamental effects such as the emergence of correlations in two-particle quantum walks, as well as strongly correlated Bloch oscillations in tilted optical lattices. Our approach can be scaled to larger systems, greatly extending the class of problems accessible via quantum walks.},

Recently, controlled protocols of quantum walk (QW) are proving to be effective simulators of such phenomena. Here we report the realization of a photonic QW showing both the trivial and the non-trivial topologies associated with chiral symmetry in one-dimensional (1D) periodic systems. We find that the probability distribution moments of the walker position after many steps can be used as direct indicators of the topological quantum transition: while varying a control parameter that defines the system phase, these moments exhibit a slope discontinuity at the transition point. Numerical simulations strongly support the conjecture that these features are general of 1D topological systems. Extending this approach to higher dimensions, different topological classes, and other typologies of quantum phases may offer general instruments for investigating and experimentally detecting quantum transitions in such complex systems.},

In this work, we focus on the equivalence of two of them, known as Szegedy‚Äôs and staggered QWs. We give a formal definition of the staggered model and discuss generalized versions for searching marked vertices. Using this formal definition, we prove that any instance of Szegedy‚Äôs model is equivalent to an instance of the staggered model. On the other hand, we show that there are instances of the staggered model that cannot be cast into Szegedy‚Äôs framework. Our analysis also works when there are marked vertices. We show that Szegedy‚Äôs spatial search algorithms can be converted into search algorithms in staggered QWs. We take advantage of the similarity of those models to define the quantum hitting time in the staggered model and to describe a method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator of staggered QWs.},

In this work, we show the conditions upon which coined QWs are equivalent to Szegedy‚Äôs QWs. Those QW models have in common a large class of instances, in the sense that the evolution operators are equal when we convert the graph on which the coined QW takes place into a bipartite graph on which Szegedy‚Äôs QW takes place, and vice versa.
